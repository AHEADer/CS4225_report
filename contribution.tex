\section{Personal contribution}
Wang Qingyuan: I read paper and analyze the difference between different kind of models and draw a whole plan for the project. I configure the environment about geo-distributed system with Yitan. I also design the model and try to find proper parameters. I use the parameters and design some experiments to verify the model with Junda. I analyze the results and make a comparison between our work and other`s work. We write the report and make the presentation together.

Li Yitan: I read the Spark source codes and give some suggestions about our project. I try to write something with the source code but it does not work well. I configure the environment about geo-distributed system with Qingyuan. I design the experiment and find proper dataset with Junda. We record and analyze the parameters which is used in the model then. We write the report and make the presentation together.

Zhang Junda: I read paper about Iridium and understand it deeply. Then I compare the methods and learn something from it. I design the experiment and find proper dataset with Yitan. We record and analyze the parameters which is used in the model then. I use the parameters and design some experiments to verify the model with Qingyuan. I use data from model to draw the figures. We write the report and make the presentation together.
